This repository contains the .mdj files (class diagrams) and .java (functions) of implemented examples for few basic Design Patterns dicovered by GoF.
1) Fighters and Payment are exempler implementation for ***Strategy design pattern***.
2) Bridge is ***Bridge design pattern*** implementation of Workshop-Vehicle.
3) Home Theatre is a ***Facade design pattern*** implementation.
